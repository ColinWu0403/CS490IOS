## Overview

This app reimagines Brightspace D2L with a modern, intuitive design to simplify course management for students at Purdue. It consolidates assignments, calendars, course materials, and notifications for all classes into a streamlined interface for each semester, making academic life more organized and efficient.

### Description

BrighterSpace serves as a centralized tool for managing all aspects of university courses in one place. Key features include an integrated assignments list with due date reminders, a customizable calendar that consolidates all course-related events, and easy access to lecture materials and resources. A grades dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of performance, while real-time notifications keep students updated on announcements and deadlines.

Designed with simplicity and usability in mind, the app eliminates the clutter and inefficiencies of the original Brightspace platform. Its clean interface, intuitive navigation, and customizable widgets empower students to stay organized, focus on their studies, and succeed academically.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** This app is useful on mobile because it allows students to quickly access their work for the day/week, and to check their assignments and grades on the go. Brightspace pulse already does this, but is slow to pull information and does not organize it in a mobile-friendly manner.
- **Story:** Brightspace 
- **Market:** Anybody that is enrolled in classes through D2L Brightspace. This includes all Purdue students. 
- **Habit:** Students would use this pretty much anytime they look at lectures, complete assignments, or check their grades. 
- **Scope:** This app would pull from all class content data, assignment data, and grade data from all the classes the user is enrolled in the current semester, and would put it all together in a user-friendly dashboard that tracks all relevant assignment and grade information in one place.
