## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Brightspace (But Better)
   - **Description**: A dashboard-style app that pulls information from all the classes on your brightspace this semester to give you an overall view of your calendar, assignment submission schedule, and your grades for the semester. 
   - **Category:** Education
   - **Mobile:** This app is useful on mobile because it allows students to quickly access their work for the day/week, and to check their assignments and grades on the go. Brightspace pulse already does this, but is slow to pull information and does not organize it in a mobile-friendly manner. 
   - **Market:** Anybody that is enrolled in classes through D2L Brightspace. This includes all Purdue students. 
   - **Habit:** Students would use this pretty much anytime they look at lectures, complete assignments, or check their grades. 
   - **Scope:** This app would pull from all class content data, assignment data, and grade data from all the classes the user is enrolled in the current semester, and would put it all together in a user-friendly dashboard that tracks all relevant assignment and grade information in one place.

2. Food Ranking App for Dining Courts and Local Restaurants
   - **Description**: A food-review style app where you individually review food options near you, which the apps then takes and creates a relative local ranking for users around your area. The app would have two sections -- one for dining courts and the other for local restaurants. 
   - **Category:** Social Networking/Food Review
   - **Mobile:** This app is a mobile app as users can take photos of thier food and upload reviews
   - **Market:** Anybody that eats (all of us).
   - **Habit:** Users would use this whenever they are at the dining courts or at restaurants and can rank their food.
   - **Scope:** This app would have two main scopes: one for Purdue dining court food, and the other for local restaurants in the city that the user is in.
